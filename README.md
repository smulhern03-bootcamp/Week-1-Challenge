# Week-1-Challenge
Analysis of Kickstarter data for Week 1 Challenge
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of Kickstarter data from 2010 to 2017 using Microsoft Excel 2016.  The campaigns covered multiple categories and subcategories.  The focus of this analysis is on theater campaigns.  The two analyses conducted were on outcomes based upon launch date and outcomes based upon fundig goals.  Analysis was conducted using various descriptive statistics, Excel functions, pivot tables and pivot charts.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize and understand the relationship between campaign launch dates and the campaign's funding goals.  The client would like to know how successful other campaigns were relative to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
As previously mentioned, two different analyses were conducted both using outcomes as the dependent variable.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The above chart shows, by month, shows how many theater campaigns are successful.  Based upon the data, May is the ideal month to launch a campaign with its very clear spike in successful campaigns relative to other months (111 successes).  This May launch time is a small window to launch campaigns, as the data also shows a very steep, steady decline over time with a year low of 37 campaign successess.  In contrast, the failed campaigns hold steady over time within a range between 30 and 55.  There was a low of 31 failed campaigns in November and a high of 52 failed campaigns in May.  Overall, May was the busiest month of the year with both the highest amount of successful campaigns and the highest amounts of failed campaigns.  

Needs analysis over success/failure rates to determine porportionality of successes/failures relative to total campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
