# Week-1-Challenge
Analysis of Kickstarter data for Week 1 Challenge
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of Kickstarter data from 2010 to 2017 using Microsoft Excel 2016.  The campaigns covered multiple categories and subcategories.  The focus of this analysis is on theater campaigns.  The two analyses conducted were on outcomes based upon launch date and outcomes based upon fundig goals.  Analysis was conducted using various descriptive statistics, Excel functions, pivot tables and pivot charts.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize and understand the relationship between campaign launch dates and the campaign's funding goals.  The client would like to know how successful other campaigns were relative to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
As previously mentioned, two different analyses were conducted both using outcomes as the dependent variable.
